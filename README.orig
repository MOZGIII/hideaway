Yay! rbIRCd is *finally* going on github. It's been, what, 3 days that haven't been version controlled?

Credits to Ruby for the 1337 OOP.
Written by danopia.
Test server MAY be up on danopia.no-ip.org (use port 7331 and join #meep)

Implemented commands:
- NICK
- USER
- WHOIS
- JOIN - doesn't take lists
- PART
- QUIT
- PRIVMSG
- NOTICE
- USERHOST
- PING
- PONG - lulz, it doesn't do anything anyway
- NAMES
- OPER
- KILL
- TOPIC
- MODE - still needs work
- LIST
- WHO
- KICK

Soon to be done:
- Ping timeouts
- Join channel list
- Modes
- Code needs to be split up across files
- Check for params to reduce errors
- Check for chanop etc. before accepting modes, topics
- INVITE
- AWAY
