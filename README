Yay! rbIRCd is *finally* going on github. It's been, what, 3 days that haven't been version controlled?

Credits to Ruby for the 1337 OOP.
Written by danopia.
Test server MAY be up on danopia.no-ip.org (use prt 7331 and join #botters)

Implemented commands:
- NICK - no validation
- USER
- WHOIS
- JOIN - no validation, won't take lists
- PART - no message yet
- QUIT - no message yet
- PRIVMSG - needs to be uppercased (the command)
- NOTICE - see PRIVMSG
- USERHOST
- PING
- PONG - lulz, it doesn't do anything anyway
- NAMES

Soon to be done:
- Nick/channel name validation
- Opering
- Ping timeouts
- Join channel list
- Better IRC parser (for part, quit, privmsg, and notice)
- Modes
- Topics
- Config file
